    Your main logic could go into a dedicated .py file,
    so that the line number in error trace would correctly map into your .py file.
    Alternatively, your logic could stay in this html file,
    so that your end user would have one less file to download, thus slightly faster.

    It is important to remember that all text/python scripts are loaded and run
    in order AFTER all the javascript scripts.
    You cannot interleave python/javascript scripts and expect them to run in order.

        When brython is done initializing everything,
        it emits a signal "brython_done" that a handler in loader.js
        captures and removes the loading blocker.

    On the first run, the parsing of your python code could take a few seconds.
    The user will see whatever loader message is on the page when this process begins.
    The css animations from load.js should continue to run during such a period.

    On subsequent runs, the modules it uses will already have been transpiled.
    It will go fast and any message you change will flash quickly.
